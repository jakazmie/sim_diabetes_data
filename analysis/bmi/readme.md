BMI (body mass index) is the ratio of weight to the square of height, in units of kg/m^2. Heights have already been added to the simulated EMR records, so the remaining feature engineering exercise is to extract the weight (in kilograms) from an "admitting history" text field. We use a web service for this. This directory includes both a sample of admitting history records, and the full collection of 100k+ records (since it is only 70MB). It includes a diagram of the ML Studio experiment that does the extraction, and the R script that goes in the "Execute R Script" module.
