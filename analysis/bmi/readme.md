BMI (body mass index) is the ratio of weight to the square of height, in units of kg/m^2. Heights have already been added to the simulated EMR records, so the remaining feature engineering exercise is to extract the weight (in kilograms) from an "admitting history" text field. We use a web service for this. This directory includes a sample of admitting history records, a diagram of the ML Studio experiment that does the extraction, and the R script that goes in the "Execute R Script" module.
